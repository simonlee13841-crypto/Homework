Project: Multi-page Portfolio Website

What I Built:
A complete 4-page responsive portfolio website including Home, About, Gallery, and Contact pages. The site features a CSS-only hero slider, responsive image galleries, contact forms, and consistent navigation across all pages.

How I Used ChatGPT:

I asked ChatGPT for:
1. Initial project structure and planning
2. Design system recommendations (colors, spacing, typography)
3. HTML structure for each page following semantic best practices
4. CSS layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid
5. Responsive breakpoints and mobile-first approach
6. CSS-only slider implementation
7. Form styling and accessibility improvements

What I Changed/Improved Manually:

1. Hero Slider: Adjusted animation timing and added overlay for better text readability
2. Navigation: Added active state indicators and improved mobile menu behavior
3. Gallery Grid: Enhanced hover effects and overlay positioning
4. Contact Form: Improved label associations and added proper form attributes
5. Responsiveness: Fine-tuned breakpoints and spacing for a better mobile experience
6. Accessibility: Added alt text, proper heading hierarchy, and form labels
7. Image Optimization: Ensured proper image sizing and aspect ratios

Key Features:
- CSS-only hero slider with 3 slides
- Responsive navigation that works on all devices
- Image galleries with hover effects
- Contact form with proper validation attributes
- Consistent design across all pages
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- No JavaScript or external frameworks used

File Structure:
- index.html (Home page with slider and previews)
- about.html (Company information and team)
- gallery.html (Image grid with overlays)
- contact.html (Contact form and information)
- style.css (All styles for the entire site)
- images/ (All project images)

The site follows the target design requirements and uses only HTML5 and CSS3 without any frameworks or JavaScript.
